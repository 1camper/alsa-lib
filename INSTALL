			ALSA library installation
			=========================

Installation from tarbal
------------------------

For installation you can use these commands:

	./configure
	make install

If ./configure command complain that alsa-driver package isn't installed,
please, check if --prefix option is same for alsa-driver and alsa-lib
package. The configure script from alsa-lib package probably cannot find
header file asound.h in $prefix/include/linux directory (usually in
/usr/include/linux directory).

Note: If you change kernel sources frequently, please, check if you have
      installed alsa-driver for current version of your kernel.

Compilation from CVS sources
----------------------------

You need also GNU packages automake and libtool installed in your system
to compile CVS sources of alsa-lib package.

For compilation you can use these commands:

	aclocal
	automake --foreign
	autoconf
	./configure
	make

Note: Some automake packages have missing aclocal program. Use newer version
      in this case.
