			ALSA library installation
			=========================

Installation from tarbal
------------------------

For installation you can use these commands:

	./configure
	make install

If ./configure command complain that alsa-driver package is not installed,
please, check if --prefix option is same for alsa-driver and alsa-lib
package. The configure script from alsa-lib package probably cannot find
header file asound.h in $prefix/include/sound directory (usually in
/usr/include/sound directory).

Note: If you change kernel sources frequently, please, check if you have
      compiled and installed alsa-driver for current version of your kernel.


Installation using a build-in version of ALSA in Linux kernel
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you use a kernel build-in version of ALSA, use:

	./configure --with-kernel=<version>
	make install

The directory /lib/modules/<version>/build/include/sound must exists for
this kind of configuration.

You may also specify the full-base for ALSA kernel headers:

	./configure --with-soundbase=<path_to_linux_include_dir>
	make install

example:

	./configure --with-soundbase=/usr/src/linux-2.5.5/include
	make install


Compilation from CVS sources
----------------------------

You need also GNU packages automake and libtool installed in your system
to compile CVS sources of alsa-lib package.

For compilation you can use these commands:

	libtoolize --force --copy --automake
	aclocal
	autoheader
	automake --foreign --copy --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure
	make

The included cvscompile script does this job for you.

Note: Some automake packages have missing aclocal program. Use newer version
      in the case.


Compilation of static library
-----------------------------

If you would like to use the static ALSA library, you need to use these
options for the configure script:

	./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes

Unfortunately, due to bug in the libtool script, the shared and static
library cannot be built together.
