================================================================

aconnect is a utility to control subscriptions of two ports as the
third "manager" client.

For example, the following connects two ports, from 64:0 to 65:0.

	% aconnect 64:0 65:0

To disconnect the existing subscription, use -d option.

	% aconnect -d 64:0 65:0

To see which port is available as input port, run the following
command:

	% aconnect -i
	client 0: 'System' [group=system] [type=kernel]
	    0 'Timer           ' [group=system]
	    1 'Announce        ' [group=system]
	client 64: '0: MIDI Synth' [group=] [type=kernel]
	    0 'card 0: synth-midi: 0' [group=device]

Similary, to see the output ports, use -o flag.

	% aconnect -o
	client 64: '0: MIDI Synth' [group=] [type=kernel]
	    0 'card 0: synth-midi: 0' [group=device]
	client 65: 'AWE Wave Table Synth : 0' [group=device] [type=kernel]
	    0 'Emu8000 port 0  ' [group=device]
	    1 'Emu8000 port 1  ' [group=device]
	    2 'Emu8000 port 2  ' [group=device]
	    3 'Emu8000 port 3  ' [group=device]

Some ports may have permission for its own group.
In such a case, change the group of aconnect to the appropriate one by
using -g option.

The option -l together with -i or -o shows subscribers for each port.

Ports are connected exclusively when the option -e is specified.

For modifying time-stamp with a queue, use -r or -t option followed by
a queue index which updates the time-stamp.  Former uses real-time queue,
while the latter uses tick queue.  The queue must be used (not necessarily
owned) by the receiver client.
